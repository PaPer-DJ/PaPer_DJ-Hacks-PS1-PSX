How to setup a new Game.

1. Open, POPS Header.data, Japan Game Licence.data and your game img.
Now make sure your at the start of your game img.

2. If your game is not Japan, you need to edit the game's Licence data to Japan.
To do so, just copy all of "Japan Game Licence.data" and add it over the start of your game img/bin.
Make sure to do "Paste write"

If your game is Japan then you don't need to do this, as its on.
